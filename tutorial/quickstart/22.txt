Close the section window, then double click one of the item blocks in the main workspace. Select the "Linked Item" checkbox, and enter the matching string in the "Link ID" field. After clicking off the box, a warning box should appear. Select "Yes", and the data from the original link will populate the fields. All changes to linked blocks will now propagate to all other blocks with the same link.
