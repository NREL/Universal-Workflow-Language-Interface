After pasting a duplicate of the workflow selection, a dark blue dotted line will be automatically drawn to connect the action blocks. This line indicates the order that protocol steps were executed in, where the position of the action block determines the order. The time sequence goes from top-to-bottom then from left-to-right in the workspace. Save your new workflow with a new name.
